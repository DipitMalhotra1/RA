I. Course Purposes 

 
This seminar is designed to serve five goals: 
(1)  To acquaint students with many of the leading theories within the field of comparative 

politics. Students will be made aware of the relevant literatures so that they will be able to 
connect their own research to broad disciplinary concerns. The weekly topics primarily 
center on dependent variables, and the readings are oriented toward leading theories (or 
proposed independent variables) that account for inter-polity or inter-temporal variations on 
the values of those dependent variables.  However, in some cases readings focus on 
definitions of key concepts. 

 
(2)  To provide examples of how best to prepare work for future submission to journals and top 

university publishers. Papers from the leading journals in the field and books from top 
publishers are included in the syllabus. Students should also peruse these journals, section 
newsletters, and publisher lists on a regular basis, not only to keep up with trends in the 
field, but also to learn the styles and forms of contributions to comparative politics.  This is 
the best way to learn about what Comparative Politics "is" and what the key debates in the 
subfield are. 

 
(3)  To introduce and make students aware of the implications of research strategies. The 

seminar will emphasize the point that methodologies in the discipline are diverse, and that 
these methods, once chosen, have considerable import for both topic choice and the range 
of findings. 

 
(4)  To develop among students critical reading, writing, collaboration, and presentation skills. 

Students will be asked to explain core concepts from the readings to the class, and will 
collaboratively work on short memos and presentations based on the readings.  In addition, 
students will write an integrated paper connecting readings with their own research 
interests. 

 
(5)  To substantively introduce students to UW-Madison faculty in comparative politics. For most 

weeks a guest faculty member will join the class discussion.

(1)  Preparation and Participation in Class Discussions: 

1.  Reading: There is a lot of material and reading is the core activity of the course. The 

readings are a subset of material from the Comparative Politics prelim reading list, which 
is available on the Learn@UW website. 
•  All students are responsible for completing all readings. 
•  All readings will be available on Dropbox or as e-books downloadable in the library. 
•  Occasional readings by guest faculty will be added. 

2.  Participation: This is a discussion-based class and active participation is essential.  Mere 

attendance is not full participation.  Active participation means being prepared by doing 
the reading and thinking about the material so that you can ask and answer questions 
related to the course material in class.  
•  Absences will only be excused due to religious conflicts or medical issues; contact 

me as soon as possible, should a medical issue or religious conflict arise.  

•  Students are expected to attend for the full class period; arriving late or leaving the 

room during class will result in a lowered participation grade. 
It is fine to use a laptop in class to take notes, but engaging in other work unrelated 
to the course during class will result in a lowered participation grade. 

• 

 
Preparation and participation grading rubric: 

A = Attended and actively participated (e.g. raised hand, and seemed in command of 

readings and material) 

B = Attended and spoke, but without evidence of a high level of preparation 
C = Attended for the full period, each time, but often did not speak 
F = Did not attend 

Note that there is no "D" reflecting the large gap between attending and not 
attending.  Also, there are no A/B or B/C grades, but those liminal grades will 
appear in the final course grades. 

•  There will be one participation grade given at the end of course, rather than 

individual grades for each class meeting. 

 
(2)  Individual Explanation of Concepts: 

 

 
 

 

Each week four to five students, chosen at random, will explain a concept from the week's 
readings.  This exercise is meant to strengthen discussion and presentation skills.  Student 
explanations should be based on mastery of the required reading and will be graded 
according to the following criteria: 

A = Outstanding explanation of concept, going beyond just description of text and 

offering original analysis. 

B = Good explanation of concept, demonstrating adequate engagement with the text. 
C = Minimally able to explain or describe concept, but only in the broadest terms. 
D = Unable to explain concept with any accuracy, suggesting a lack of familiarity with the 

reading. 

F = Did not attend

(3)  Group Memos and Presentations: 

•  To start off our discussions, each week students will work in groups of 2 or 3 to prepare 
a short memo and a 10-15 minute oral presentation based on the readings. The goal is 
to highlight interesting aspects of the readings and to provide points for further 
discussion.  Presentations should be modeled on the role of a discussant at a 
professional conference.  Through this activity students will improve their presentation 
skills and the ability to concisely analyze, categorize, and write about political science 
literature.  Group presentation dates will be set at the first class meeting.  Each student 
will participate in three during the semester, and students should choose weeks from at 
least two different broader themes (e.g. political economy, institutions, identity, conflict). 

 

 

 
 

 

Memos should: 
•  Be in bullet point format, no longer than 2 single-spaced pages (12 point font, 1-inch 

margins); 

•  Sort readings into types or categories; 
•  Highlight key arguments; 
•  Make connections among the readings; 
• 
•  Be posted on Learn@UW as a PDF by 12:00 pm on the day before the seminar 

Include three discussion questions at the end; 

(Wednesday). 

assigned; 

 
Presentations: 
•  Must include all readings and should not veer into discussion of reading that was not 

•  Students should work together to develop an integrated presentation; do not just divide 
up the reading.  All students should be able to discuss all readings, and the division of 
the presentation should be based on substantive themes or theories, rather than 
different works; 

•  Should not include slides, unless there is a figure that needs to be shown; 
•  Will not be allowed to go past 15 minutes; 
•  Presenters should engage with the class and not simply read notes. 

Grading criteria (includes memo and presentation): 

A = Outstanding analysis of readings, including original or innovative insights in a well-
integrated presentation and set of discussion questions, and engaging delivery of 
material 

B = Made connections between readings, going beyond just description of main 

arguments, and provided insightful discussion questions 

C = Accurately captured the main arguments or critical points in all of the readings and 

provided relevant discussion questions, and memo posted on time. 

D = Egregiously inaccurate or incomplete discussion of readings (did not include all 

readings ) or did not provide discussion questions 

F = Did not attend or participate in presentation or memo-writing.

(4)  Final project: The final project will be a paper of no more than 2500 words (approximately 
6-7 single-spaced pages), including citations.  The goal of this paper is to draw connections 
between readings in the course and your research goals, which hopefully will help you 
develop your dissertation research question and embed your dissertation in existing 
literature.  You should be considering your own research interests as well as sources for this 
project throughout the semester. The paper should have 2 sections: 
•  A discussion of your own research interests (500 words) 
•  A discussion of two topics from the course that are related to your research interests 

(approximately 1000 words each). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Project requirements: 
1.  Title: Give your project a title that describes your research topic.  When people ask you 

"what are you interested in?" or "what do you work on?" this should be your answer. 

2.  Define a field of interest to you in approximately 500 words.  This should describe what 

you plan to study.  Do not just summarize a literature.  Say explicitly what you plan to 
work on within a literature (or literatures), so that the topics in the second part follow 
from the description of your interests.   

3.  Choose two theoretical topics (from the 13 substantive course meetings) that are related 

to your research interests.  For each topic, in approximately 1000 words, you should 
discuss the key questions that the literature in that topic addresses and how existing 
work, including sources listed on the syllabus, connects to your research interests.   
• 

In discussing specific sources you should not just summarize main arguments, but 
instead explain why is it important and what it adds that other readings don’t.  You 
may also explain why certain work or approaches to a question are not applicable to 
your interests.  For example: 
o 

"This book is a foundational work on state formation, which is well cited in the 
literature.  I disagree with the argument for reasons X, Y, and Z, but think it 
provides a useful foil for my argument." 
"This book includes gender, and is the only one on this topic to do so, but it 
leaves out class, so I want to build on it." 
"This article links civil society and violence, focusing on decentralization, and is 
the only one to put those three variables together, and hence is innovative." 
"This book looks at national identity in Latin America, and I'm interested in Africa, 
but I thought I could learn from the Latin American experience." 
"This article has a data set on political violence, which is unique.  I want to 
compare it with some other case studies."

4.  Other important requirements: 

•  The final project is due as a .pdf posted to Learn@UW on Monday, December 16th, 

•  12 point font, single-spaced, 1-inch margins, include page numbers. 
•  Cite all your sources fully and properly. 
•  Title your file that you upload with your name (e.g. "SmithPS856.pdf," not 

10:00 am. 

"PS856.pdf");
