    "Description": "Situation theory is the result of an interdisciplinary effort to create a full-fledged theory of information. Created by scholars and scientists from cognitive science, computer science, AI, linguistics, logic, philosophy, and mathematics, the theory is forging a common set of tools for the analysis of phenomena from all these fields. This volume presents work that evolved out of the Second Conference on Situation Theory and its Applications. Twenty-six essays exhibit the wide range of the theory, covering such topics as natural language semantics, philosophical issues about information, mathematical applications, and the visual representation of information in computer systems.Jon Barwise is a professor of philosophy, mathematics, and logic at Indiana University in Bloomington. Jean Mark Gawron is a researcher at SRI International and a consultant at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories. Gordon Plotkin is a professor of theoretical computer science at the University of Edinburgh.

Anticipating both the phenomenological hermeneutical analysis of factical Dasein in Being and Time (1927) and the poetic thinking in Heidegger's writings after 1930, the experimental theme of these renowned lecture course notes from the summer semester of 1923 is the \"be-ing there\" of facticity in \"the awhileness of its temporal particularity.\" The 33-year-old Heidegger illustrates this theme with an ingenious interpretation of the table in his home and the activities of his young family around it.",

    "Description": "Significant as has been the role of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in contemporary culture and society, its importance continues to grow at an accelerating rate as more specific, focused, and involving forms of therapy are devised. The contributions of eminent practitioners that make up this volume deal with specific types of occurrences in the confrontation between patient and therapist, such as silence, crying, sleeping, touching, use of first names, gifts, note taking, termination, etc. The views expressed here demonstrate how the rigidity of early psychoanalytic theory has yielded to fundamental changes in the handling of the analytic situation; numerous new schools of thought have arisen in attempts to give deeper fulfillment to the needs of patient, analyst, and society. The persuasions of these new schools--Gestaltist, existentialist, neo-Freudian, behavioralist, ego psychologist, rational-emotive, encounter, and many others--underlie the material presented here. Impulsiveness and originality mark all of these departures from orthodoxy. The therapist, becoming more open and more manifestly responsive in his interaction with the patient, is clearly shifting his role from that of an objective listener and interpreter to that of an overt participant in therapy. These trends are further intensified by the fact that the practice of psychotherapy is now carried on, by a vast number of clinical psychologists, personality psychologists, social psychologists, and social workers who have taken up psychotherapy as a professional activity in urban mental health clinics and in a variety of settings outside the major American metropolitan areas. The Analytic Situation provides informative, revealing reading for everyone involved in the psychotherapeutic process. It also offers provocative insights to students and therapists in training. Hendrik M. Ruitenbeek is on the faculty of the American Institute for Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis. He received his Ph.D. and L.L.D. from the University of Leyden, and is the author of more than 25 books in the social sciences and psychoanalysis, including Group Therapy Today: Styles, Methods, and Techniques, Interpretation of Death, and Psychoanalysis and Male Sexuality.",

    "Description": "This book is a unique source of information on the present state of the exciting field of molecular cytogenetics and how it can be applied in research and diagnostics. The basic techniques of fluorescence in situ hybridization and primed in situ hybridization (PRINS) are outlined, the multiple approaches and probe sets that are now available for these techniques are described, and applications of them are presented in 36 chapters by authors from ten different countries around the world. The book not only provides the reader with basic and background knowledge on the topic, but also gives detailed protocols that show how molecular cytogenetics is currently performed by specialists in this field. The FISH Application Guide initially provides an overview of the (historical) development of molecular cytogenetics, its basic procedures, the equipment required, and probe generation. The book then describes tips and tricks for making different tissues available for molecular cytogenetic studies. These are followed by chapters on various multicolor FISH probe sets, their availability, and their pot- tial for use in combination with other approaches. The possible applications that are shown encompass the characterization of marker chromosomes, cryptic cytogenetic aberrations and epigenetic changes in humans by interphase and metaphase cyto- netics, studies of nuclear architecture, as well as the application of molecular cytogenetics to zoology, botany and microbiology.",

    "Description": "\"Explanation and Understanding, perhaps von Wright's best-known book, showed the influence of Wittgenstein, but marked a clean break with the positivism of his youth. He suggested that human action could not be explained causally by scientific or 'natural' laws, but had to be understood 'intentionally'\u2014a concept connected with wants and beliefs developed in a social and cultural context.\"\u2014Daily Telegraph\"This is a very good book packed with much original material; it also contains illuminating reinterpretations of some familiar theories and arguments. The range of topics treated includes causation, action, verification of gnomic statements, practical inference and its use in the explanation of action, and the structure of explanation in history.\"\u2014Philosophical Review",

    "Description": "This book is the first to combine principles from analytics, complex systems theory, multi-disciplinary diagnostics and sport performance analysis. It considers athletes, teams, and sport organizations in individual and team games as complex systems, and demonstrates how complexity studies can enrich analytics and give us a more sophisticated understanding of the causalities of winning and losing in sports. Part I introduces the basic categories of analytics and their uses in elite sport. Part II presents an original conception of sport analytics both as a complex of different kinds of processes and as a complexity-adapted view of human systems acting in sport performance and management. Part III considers the main principles of complex sport analytics, expanding the prism of complexity to include all levels of a sport organization from athletes, coaches and trainers to top decision makers, and suggests practical applications and simulations for cases of both individual and team sports. This is illuminating reading for any advanced student, researcher or practitioner working in sport analytics, performance analysis, coaching science or sport management.",

Her earliest memories are marked by these numbers, but it takes her father's premature death for Maddie and her family to realize that these mysterious digits are actually death dates, and just like birthdays, everyone has one. Forced by her alcoholic mother to use her ability to make extra money, Maddie identifies the quickly approaching death date of one client's young son, but because her ability only allows her to see the when and not the how, she's unable to offer any more insight. When the boy goes missing on that exact date, law enforcement turns to Maddie. Soon, Maddie is entangled in a homicide investigation, and more young people disappear and are later found murdered. A suspect for the investigation, a target for the murderer, and attracting the attentions of a mysterious young admirer who may be connected to it all, Maddie's whole existence is about to be turned upside down. Can she right things before it's too late?",

    "Description": "In this charming follow-up to 2015's hit Who Done It?, each page asks the reader a question about the lineup of characters featured on the spread. Sharp eyes and keen observation are necessary. There's only one right answer, and it's not always easy! Kids will love learning early concepts like expressions and positions as a natural consequence of their hunt for clues in the details of the lineup. It's a book for all audiences: the seek-and-find call to action of every page makes Who What Where? a wonderful lap or parent read. Plus, this is the fixed format version, which looks almost identical to the print edition.",

    "Description": "This book is concerned with the processing of signals that have been sam pled and digitized. The fundamental theory behind Digital Signal Process ing has been in existence for decades and has extensive applications to the fields of speech and data communications, biomedical engineering, acous tics, sonar, radar, seismology, oil exploration, instrumentation and audio signal processing to name but a few [87]. The term \"Digital Signal Processing\", in its broadest sense, could apply to any operation carried out on a finite set of measurements for whatever purpose. A book on signal processing would usually contain detailed de scriptions of the standard mathematical machinery often used to describe signals. It would also motivate an approach to real world problems based on concepts and results developed in linear systems theory, that make use of some rather interesting properties of the time and frequency domain representations of signals. While this book assumes some familiarity with traditional methods the emphasis is altogether quite different. The aim is to describe general methods for carrying out optimal signal processing.",
